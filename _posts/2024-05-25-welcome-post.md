The Express blog will be a primary means of communication for the Express technical committee (TC) and in the long run we hope it will become a communication hub for the entire Express community.

The Express blog will be a venue:
- For the Express TC to discuss issues of particular importance to the Express community.
- For periodic information on new releases, pre-releases, plans, and ongoing work on the project.
- To highlight security issues or other urgent information.

Eventually, the blog may evolve into a more general communication point for the community; for example to share examples, tips, and experiences using packages in the Express ecosystem.

Initially, posts will be written by TC members (potentially collaborating others), mainly because we don't have bandwidth to review general posts from the broader community. Eventually, we would love to open up the blog for broader contributions, but for now the focus is on trying to release Express 5.0, and the reality of an open-source project is that everyone has finite time to contribute. 

If you think you have a great idea for a post for future consideration, feel free to pitch the idea! The best approach is to open a new issue, and then after appropriate discussion, open a PR.  We've also written up simple [instructions to create a blog post](/en/blog/write-post.html).
